\section{Goals}
\begin{frame}{Goals and what we implemented from a user's eyes}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Indexes are crucial for efficient query execution in relational databases.
		\item However, developers sometimes forget to create indexes for frequently queried columns.
		\item This can lead to repeated full relation scans, significantly degrading performance.
		\item {\bf Goal:} Modify the application layer of PostgreSQL to detect such patterns and automatically create indexes when beneficial.
		\item {\bf Another Goal} was to understand and implement the paper \textit{``An Auto-Indexing Technique for Databases Based on Clustering''} \cite{1333569}.
		\item We implemented an interface that can take and submit queries from users as usual as well as automatically create (and remove) indices appropriately, thereby improving performance without any user intervention.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Frequency Calculation}
\begin{frame}{Calculating the frequency of relations and their attributes}
For Stage 1 of this project, we made a simple parser, which gives us the list of relations, and the attributes involved in some query. This helps us know the number of times, a particular attribute of a relation is accessed, this in turn can be used to make the decision on whether we should construct an index on that attribute.

For a sample run, the \texttt{\textbackslash show} command can be used to display the frequency results.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Results}
	Here is the sample output:

\end{frame}

\section{An Auto-Indexing Technique for Databases Based on Clustering}

\begin{frame}{An Auto-Indexing Technique for Databases Based on Clustering}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Automate the physical design so that the task of the database administrator (DBA) is minimized.
		\item The first category is external tools which use linear programming optimization techniques and other cost minimization techniques to solve the Index Selection Problem.
		\item The second category is the tools that utilize the query optimizer to give cost estimates for various index
		configurations and suggest a configuration with the least cost estimation.
		\item In this technique the optimizer is invoked only once for each query in the workload to choose the final set of indexes from a set of externally determined index configurations.
		\item 
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Identifying Candidate Indexes}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A query attribute matrix is created.
		\item The presence of an indexable attribute is created by 1 and absence by a 0.
		\item The condition applied is:
		
		\texttt{Freq > threshold1 OR Freq * T > threshold2}
		\item \texttt{Freq} is the frequency of each indexable attribute in the workload and \texttt{T} is proportional to the size of the table in rows to which the column belongs.
		\item Weights of 3, 2, 1 are given to the columns occurring in a {\tt WHERE} clause, {\tt GROUP BY} or {\tt ORDER BY} clauses and aggregate functions, respectively.
		\item During the clustering phase queries that are similar based on common and frequently occurring attributes are clustered together.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Candidate index suggestion}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item During this phase, those candidate indexable attributes which are common to all the queries clustered together during the clustering phase are suggested as indexes.
		\item The optimizer uses its statistics and cost estimates to choose indexes for each query.
		\item Those indexes not being picked up by the optimizer are dropped because the presence of these unused indexes will cause an overhead of space and maintenance in the database.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% \section{Next Steps}

% \begin{frame}{Next Steps}
% 	Firstly, we need to create a cost function, which when crosses a threshold, will give us a signal, and an index creation will begin. After this, we need to implement a simple index creation (and removal) policy, such that LRU, MRU, LFU etc. Apart from this, here is the list of papers, which we are planning to read, and will implement the ideas of one of them:
% 	\begin{itemize}
% 		\item A tool for automatic index selection in Database Management Systems
% 		\item Automatic Index Selection in RDBMS by Exploring Query Execution Plan Space
% 		\item Automated Database Indexing Using Model-Free Reinforcement Learning
% 	\end{itemize}
